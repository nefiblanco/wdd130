                <p id="par-1">First, we need to start with a prayer, which invites the Spirit to be with us and He can be the one teaching us, in our prayer, we could ask Him what He wants us to read. The Book of Mormon is amazing because no matter which page you open, you’ll find something that can help you learn and grow in that precise moment.</p>
                <div class = "mid-background" id="mid-background2"></div>
                <p id="par-2">Second, we read the verse, chapter, etc but while we’re reading it we have to have something in mind… The prophet that wrote this book had little material to write as it was written on golden plates, meaning he needed to use the exact wording so it could be understandable and clear for what the Lord wanted us to learn, having this in mind, we have to think why would the prophet use this word instead of the other (example: why would he use “walk with Him” instead of “be with him”), after finishing the reading, it’s important to ask as many questions as possible and write them down, sometimes while we’re reading or writing the questions, answers can come to our mind and we need to be ready to recognize them and write them down.</p>
                <h1 id="par-3">Following this process, studying the Book of Mormon will become an amazing experience and a step toward our Father in Heaven. We finish with a prayer at the end of it!</h1>
