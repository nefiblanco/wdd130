        The book of Mormon is an abridgment of scriptures written by ancient prophets that lived in the Americas. It starts at 600b.C. and ends at 321a.C, these prophets knew about Jesus Christ before he came to the earth, other ones, knew Him when he visited the Americas, and the rest were faithful followers of Him after his ascension to heaven. The book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ, every single prophet that wrote on it, wrote about Christ, His divine power, and the power of His Atonement. The main message of the Book of Mormon is to come to know Jesus Christ as a brother, a Father, and a friend. Thanks to the Book of Mormon, we can have the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ for it is explained in plainness and certainty. The best way to know the truth about the Book of Mormon is to ask God In the name of Jesus Christ if it’s true and it promises that He will answer in our hearts through the Holy Ghost. If anyone reads the Book of Mormon, follows its teachings, and lives according to them, that person can receive a witness of Jesus Christ and the fullness of His glory.

      <h3>My Testimony</h3>
      <p>
        The Book of Mormon has changed my life. When I first joined the church of Jesus Christ, I was just a young man and didn’t understand who Jesus Christ was, even though I have been through my whole life by then. The only thing I knew was that He had done a sacrifice for us and that He was our brother in a certain way, so, I knew He existed, I knew the Book of Mormon was true but I knew it just because I felt like home when I used to go to church or read it for a couple of minutes. The day came when I needed to go to serve a mission, I was about to testify about Jesus Christ and his Gospel and the only evidence I had that it was restored was the Book of Mormon, so I started reading it as any other book I had at home but I realized it was not the same, it wasn’t something I could memorize, like a history book, or something I could analyze, like a chemistry book, I realized the way to read it was through the Holy Ghost and when I came to understand this, everything changed. Suddenly, the book had life itself, it was teaching me things about myself, my past, present, and future life, but most importantly, it thought me about Jesus Christ, the one that made all these things possible, I came to know Him the way He is, as a friend, a brother, and a Father, I came to know him, I knew that He lives and that He’s always there to help us, The Book of Mormon showed me how to reach out to Him so that He could respond, it thought me to hear Jesus Christ’s voice and recognize the promptings of the Spirit, it helped me not just to change my actions but my whole self, I was born again as a new creature and I testify of that in the name of Jesus Christ.

      <h3>How To Read It?</h3>
      <p>
        First, we need to start with a prayer, which invites the Spirit to be with us and He can be the one teaching us, in our prayer, we could ask Him what He wants us to read. The Book of Mormon is amazing because no matter which page you open, you’ll find something that can help you learn and grow in that precise moment. Second, we read the verse, chapter, etc but while we’re reading it we have to have something in mind… The prophet that wrote this book had little material to write as it was written on golden plates, meaning he needed to use the exact wording so it could be understandable and clear for what the Lord wanted us to learn, having this in mind, we have to think why would the prophet use this word instead of the other (example: why would he use “walk with Him” instead of “be with him”), after finishing the reading, it’s important to ask as many questions as possible and write them down, sometimes while we’re reading or writing the questions, answers can come to our mind and we need to be ready to recognize them and write them down. Following this process, studying the Book of Mormon will become an amazing experience and a step toward our Father in Heaven. We finish with a prayer at the end of it!
